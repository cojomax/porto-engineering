# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## The Client

The parent company is called Porto Engineering. They do steel manufacturing and high-precision fabrication. The sister
company is Porto Plumbing and they offer professional plumbing and solar water heating services tailored to meet the
needs of homes and businesses.

## Project

We are building two websites, one for each business focus. The sites will share a theme and many UI components.
They will mostly differ in copy and images that are used.

Two Astro sites deployed to Cloudflare Workers via `@astrojs/cloudflare`.

Package manager is **pnpm** (see `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`).

## Architecture

- **Cloudflare adapter**: `astro.config.mjs` sets `adapter: cloudflare()`, so `pnpm build` produces a Cloudflare Worker (entrypoint `@astrojs/cloudflare/entrypoints/server`), not a static site or Node server. `wrangler.jsonc` configures the Worker (name, static assets binding pointing at `./dist`, compatibility date/flags). Any Cloudflare bindings (KV, D1, R2, env vars, etc.) get added to `wrangler.jsonc`, and `pnpm generate-types` must be rerun so `worker-configuration.d.ts` (included in `tsconfig.json`) reflects them.
- **Routing**: file-based, under `src/pages/` — each `.astro` file becomes a route.
- **Layouts/components**: `src/layouts/Layout.astro` is the base HTML shell; page-level composition wraps components (e.g. `src/components/Welcome.astro`) in a layout, as in `src/pages/index.astro`.
- **Assets**: static files served as-is from `public/`; imported/processed assets (optimized by Astro) live in `src/assets/`.

## Design and Theme

The primary color is #5B9BCD.

## Commands

```
pnpm install              # install dependencies
pnpm dev                  # start dev server at localhost:4321
pnpm build                # build production site to ./dist/ (Cloudflare Worker output)
pnpm preview               # preview the Cloudflare build locally (via wrangler)
pnpm astro check           # type-check .astro files
pnpm generate-types        # regenerate worker-configuration.d.ts from wrangler.jsonc (run after editing wrangler.jsonc)
```

When starting the dev server as an agent, use background mode instead of `pnpm dev`:

```
astro dev --background
```

Manage the background server with `astro dev stop`, `astro dev status`, and `astro dev logs`.

There is no test suite or linter configured in this repo yet.
